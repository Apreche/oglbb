OpenGL Building Blocks (oglbb)
by Scott Rubin

This program is my term project for Computer Graphics 2

This program allows the user to create 3d models consisting solely of cubes.  It
has many features including zoom, pan, 32 bit color, save and load and more. 

The gui is simple and self explanatory, I hope. It is made using gtk+-2.0, 
gtkglext and OpenGL. To run the program do the following

unzip and untar the source
since you are reading this you must have done this already

run "make"

run "./oglbb"

That's it! This program has been tested and found to work with the following

gtk+-2.0
gtkglext-1.0
Solaris 9
Linux 2.6.0
gcc 3.3
NVidia Cg Toolkit
